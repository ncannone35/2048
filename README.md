This program runs the game 2048.  To play, the user must compile the program, and run it.  The user will then use the keys ‘a’, ‘s’, ‘d’, and ‘w’ for 
left, down, right, up respectively.  After entering in the desired key, the user must hit enter.  If the user wishes to restart the game, they will type ‘r’, 
hit enter, and then type ‘c’ to confirm.  If the user wishes to quit the game, they will type ‘q’, hit enter, and then type ‘c’ to confirm.  The game will either 
end once there are no available moves, the user quits, or the user achieves a tile of 2048.  Tiles with an asterisk represent the value 0.
